Spices up your factorio experience by making once static module effects to fluctuate over time (customizable)

Default patterns include:
- Sine Wave - Module effect gradually oscillates between 200% and 0% over the course of 100 seconds
- Toggle - Module effect toggles instantly between 200% and 0% every minute
- Decay - Module effect starts at 300% but halves every minute for 10 minutes until stopping at 5% effect after an hour
- Custom - define your own effects!
